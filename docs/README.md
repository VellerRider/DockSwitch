Place your showcase screenshot here as `showcase.png`.

Tips:
- Save the screenshot named `showcase.png` inside this `docs/` folder.
- Recommended size: max width 780px for better rendering in README.

Example (macOS):
1. Open the screenshot in Preview.
2. Export → PNG → Save as `showcase.png` in the `docs/` folder.

After adding the image, commit the file and push to GitHub to make the image visible in the repository README.
